				<h2 class="page-header text-center">B.E. Final Year Project</h2><hr>
				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">Advanced active detection and prevention of water leakage in concealed pipes</h2>
				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>The proposed project involves active detection of water leakage in fluid pipelines either in the industries or in a concealed/underground environment. </p>
					<p>On detection, it stops the leakage at the mouth of the faulty pipe by the use of solenoid valves.</p>
					<p>The Proposed Solution Makes use of flow sensors attached to every end of the pipe to detect the continuity of fluid in the pipes. The system logs all the data to a remote server and also reports its findings to the administrator via the control panel UI that is provided over a webURL. From there, the user can give commands to stop or resume the flow of water in the pipeline.</p>

				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">Texture Enabled Haptic Feedback Of Touchscreen</h2>

				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>In the current scenario, the touch screens be it capacitive or resistive are confined to just the visualization of an image. The Texture enabled haptic feedback of the touch screen presents a variation to the conventional model of the touch screen. This particular technology, commonly referred to as Haptic Feedback, is implemented on a capacitive touch screen wherein the texture of some particular object could be felt by just a mere touch. The signal generated by the human body on touching a real world object is cloned. This cloned signal is recognized by the actuators that produce vibrations and on moving your finger across the screen, a texture is recognized. This technology brings a sense of realism where the object can, not just be seen but, can also be felt.</p>
