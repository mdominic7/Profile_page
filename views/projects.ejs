				<h2 class="page-header text-center">B.E. Final Year Project</h2><hr>
				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">Advanced active detection and prevention of water leakage in concealed pipes</h2>
				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>The proposed project involves active detection of water leakage in fluid pipelines either in the industries or in a concealed/underground environment. </p>
					<p>On detection, it stops the leakage at the mouth of the faulty pipe by the use of solenoid valves.</p>
					<p>The Proposed Solution Makes use of flow sensors attached to every end of the pipe to detect the continuity of fluid in the pipes. The system logs all the data to a remote server and also reports its findings to the administrator via the control panel UI that is provided over a webURL. From there, the user can give commands to stop or resume the flow of water in the pipeline.</p>

				<h3 class="page-header text-center">India Innovation Challenge Design Contest 2016</h3><hr>
				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">Texture Enabled Haptic Feedback Of Touchscreen</h2>

				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>In the current scenario, the touch screens be it capacitive or resistive are confined to just the visualization of an image. The Texture enabled haptic feedback of the touch screen presents a variation to the conventional model of the touch screen. This particular technology, commonly referred to as Haptic Feedback, is implemented on a capacitive touch screen wherein the texture of some particular object could be felt by just a mere touch. The signal generated by the human body on touching a real world object is cloned. This cloned signal is recognized by the actuators that produce vibrations and on moving your finger across the screen, a texture is recognized. This technology brings a sense of realism where the object can, not just be seen but, can also be felt.</p>

				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">IOT Blynk-cloud based smart home automation for home</h2>

				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>Imagine a future where everything in your home can be controlled at the press of a button, without breaking a single drop of sweat! Imagine a future where you wake up in the morning and while you brush your teeth, the coffee maker and the bread toaster get to work on their own to deliver piping hot coffee to start your day great! Imagine that you leave work and head home and the system at your house automatically senses the weather outside and adjusts the HVAC settings for you!</p>
					<p>Well, guess what? the future is here with an IOT based smart home system, you dont have to worry about anything at your house.
					The coolest part is controlling all your appliances, lights ,fans, TV's at the press of a button...</p>
					<p>Hell Yeah! you guessed it right, ive built my own smart home system for my room! I dont have to wake up to switch on the tv or the lights!</p>

				<!-- <h3 class="page-header text-center">India Innovation Challenge Design Contest 2016</h3> --><hr>
				<h2 class="text-capitalize text-justify">IOT (MQTT) based Automated Garden System</h2>

				<div class="text-justify">
					<p>This is a very well engineered system, built on the Espressif ESP8266 chipset, sporting a custom built soil sensor and a host of other sensors like the dht11. This system measures the moisture in the soil at regular intervals of time and waters the plants as needed.It keeps track of the environment parameters like relative humidity and ambient temperature to adjust its watering schedule.</p>
					<p>This system is completely built on the popular Mosquitto Broker which distributes the generated information over the cloud to various clients...This system is also integrated with Node-RED to bring in a host of features like email notifications, Amazon Alexa integrations, etc.</p>
